# ErisPulse-App

[ErisPulse-App](https://github.com/ErisPulse/ErisPulse-App) is the **official multi-platform client** directly maintained by ErisDev (released for Android / Windows / Linux / macOS), providing a fully native graphical management interface: create, run, and manage multiple bot instances on your phone or computer, without the need for a terminal or a separate Python environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ErisPulse-App is an **independently installed client application**, not a module installed via `epsdk install`. It includes a built-in Python runtime and ErisPulse SDK, ready to use upon installation—**can even run directly on mobile devices**.

## Feature Overview

- **Multiple Instance Management**: Create / Start / Stop / Delete multiple instances, with ports and access tokens automatically assigned. Supports new environments or cloning existing environments.
- **Overview Dashboard**: Adapter / Module / Online Robot / Total Event Count statistics, CPU / Memory usage alerts with color changes.
- **Module Store**: Search and tag filtering, one-click install / upgrade / uninstall, install specific versions, support for pip mirror sources and Git packages.
- **Event Stream + Event Builder**: Real-time event viewing, visual construction of test events and submission to adapters.
- **Monitoring**: Unified view of logs / lifecycle / audit.
- **Command Management**: Global settings such as prefixes and aliases, enable/disable and platform whitelists/blacklists.
- **Robot Overview / Configuration / File Management**: Direct native interface operations on instances.
- **Background Persistence**: Android foreground service for survival; Windows minimize to system tray, closing the window does not interrupt instances.
- **Dynamic Module Windows**: Automatically appear in the sidebar navigation (same group as Dashboard) for pages registered by modules, click to navigate directly.

## Supported Platforms

All platform installers can be downloaded from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ErisPulse/ErisPulse-App/releases); simply choose the one that suits your needs:

| Platform | Installer | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Android | `online-*.apk` / `offline-*.apk` | **Run directly on your phone**, no computer required |
| Windows | `windows-x64-setup.exe` / `windows-x64.zip` | Installer version / portable version |
| Linux | `linux-x64.tar.gz` | Extract and use |
| macOS | `macos-arm64.zip` | Apple Silicon (arm64) |

A single Flutter codebase covers all platforms.

## Installation Method (Android / Direct Phone Execution)

Download the APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ErisPulse/ErisPulse-App/releases) and install it. There are two builds available:

| Build | Runtime Image | Use Case |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| `erispulse-app-online-*.apk` | Downloaded on first launch | Smaller installation package, suitable for good network conditions |
| `erispulse-app-offline-*.apk` | Embedded in the APK | Offline self-contained, no internet required after installation |

Both builds follow the same installation steps:

1. Download and install the APK, and allow notification permissions when prompted (to keep the background service alive).
2. After the initialization banner appears on the home screen, click to run the first initialization (including progress and log views).
3. Create an instance and start it.
4. Configure adapters and model API keys in the App's built-in management interface.

> The offline package is self-contained—no internet connection is required after installation. If the download is slow or unstable on first launch, you can switch the download source to a mirror (ghfast / gh-proxy) in the settings page.

### Installation Method (Desktop: Windows / Linux / macOS)

1. Download the installation package for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ErisPulse/ErisPulse-App/releases)  
   (Windows: `setup.exe` or portable `zip`, Linux: `tar.gz`, macOS: `zip`)
2. Install and launch the application.
3. On the welcome page, select the ErisPulse SDK version to install (default is the latest).
4. Create an instance and start it.

## How It Works

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ErisPulse-App (Flutter)                            │
│                                                    │

│       ├── Android: Foreground Service + proot + Ubuntu rootfs │
│       │        + Python + ErisPulse Instance       │
│       └── Desktop: Built-in Python + Direct Process Management │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Android**: The instance runs within a proot (userspace chroot) hosted by a foreground service (background isolate). Even after the UI is closed, the bot continues to run and automatically restarts on crash.
- **Desktop**: The instance runs as a direct child process of the App. On Windows, it supports minimizing to the system tray to stay in the background (closing the window does not interrupt the instance). When the App restarts, it automatically resumes management of any still-running instances, and all instances are stopped together when exiting.
- On all platforms, the native UI communicates with the instance through the REST / WebSocket API at `127.0.0.1:<port>/Dashboard/*`, sharing the same API as [ErisPulse-Dashboard](dashboard.md).

## Relationship with SDK

- ErisPulse SDK is embedded in the App: Android is bundled in the Ubuntu image, desktop is installed from PyPI (optional version on welcome page, default latest)
- Instances in the App are equivalent to those created by the command line `epsdk`, and can use the same modules/adapters
- Module developers can register custom pages via the [Dashboard window registration API](dashboard.md): the window will automatically appear in the App's side navigation (grouped the same as Dashboard), and clicking will navigate to the corresponding page for rendering
