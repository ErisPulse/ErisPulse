> Additionally, there is a `sandbox` adapter, but this adapter does not require a platform-specific features documentation.

## General Interface

### Send Method Chaining

All adapters support the following standard calling methods:

> **Note:** The `{AdapterName}` in the documentation should be replaced with the actual adapter name (e.g., `yunhu`, `telegram`, `onebot11`, `email`, etc.).

1. Specify type and ID: `To(type, id).Func()`
   ```python
   # Get adapter instance
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   
   # Send message
   await my_adapter.Send.To("user", "U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   yunhu = adapter.get("yunhu")
   await yunhu.Send.To("user", "U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
2. Specify ID only: `To(id).Func()`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   telegram = adapter.get("telegram")
   await telegram.Send.To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
3. Specify sender account: `Using(account_id)`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.Using("bot1").To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   onebot11 = adapter.get("onebot11")
   await onebot11.Send.Using("bot1").To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
4. Direct call: `Func()`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.Text("Broadcast message")
   
   # Example:
   email = adapter.get("email")
   await email.Send.Text("Broadcast message")
   ```

#### Asynchronous Sending and Result Handling

The methods of the Send DSL return an `asyncio.Task` object, which means you can choose whether to wait for the result immediately:

```python
# Get adapter instance
my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")

# Do not wait for result, message is sent in the background
task = my_adapter.Send.To("user", "123").Text("Hello")

# If you need to get the sending result, you can wait later
result = await task
```

#### Send Rule Decorators

In practical development, you often need to: execute subsequent logic only after successful sending, automatically retry on failure, cancel on timeout, monitor sending progress, etc. The Send DSL includes a set of built-in send rule decorators, which can be attached via chained methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.Hook(callback)` | Callback executed after successful sending (can be called multiple times) |
| `.Retry(times=1)` | Automatic retry N times on failure (total of N+1 attempts including the first) |
| `.Timeout(seconds)` | Single send timeout, cancel on timeout (can be stacked with Retry) |
| `.Defer(seconds)` | Delay sending (in-process timer, not persisted) |
| `.OnProgress(callback)` | Progress callback at each stage, passing in SendContext |
| `.OnError(callback)` | Error callback on final failure (triggers only once) |

```python
yunhu = adapter.get("yunhu")

# Deduct points only after successful sending
await (yunhu.Send.To("user", "123")
       .Hook(lambda r: deduct_points("123"))
       .Text("Success"))

# Retry on failure + timeout cancellation + progress monitoring
def on_progress(ctx):
    print(f"Stage: {ctx.stage}, Attempt: {ctx.attempt + 1}/{ctx.max_attempts}")

task = (yunhu.Send.To("user", "123")
        .Retry(3)              # Retry up to 3 times
        .Timeout(10)           # Timeout of 10 seconds per attempt
        .OnProgress(on_progress)
        .OnError(lambda ctx: notify_admin(ctx.error))
        .Text("Important notification"))
```

Rule methods return `self`, and must be called before the sending methods (Text/Image, etc.). `SendContext` includes fields such as `stage` (pending/sending/retrying/success/failed/timeout), `attempt`, `elapsed`, `error`, and `result`, which are useful for monitoring.

#### Batch Build Mode (Build)

Build multiple sending methods in a single chain, then execute them all at once. This is suitable for scenarios where you need to send multiple messages in one go:

```python
yunhu = adapter.get("yunhu")

# Build multiple messages and send them all at once
results = await (yunhu.Send.To("user", "123")
                .Build()                     # Enter build mode
                .Text("Notification 1")
                .Image("pic.jpg")
                .Text("Notification 2")
                .send_all())                 # Execute all at once
# results = [Text result, Image result, Text result]
```

`.send_all()` executes by default in **parallel** (concurrent sending, high efficiency). To ensure the order of message arrival, call `.Sequential()` for sequential execution:

```python
# Sequential execution (ensures order) + retry on failure
await (yunhu.Send.To("group", "456")
       .Build()
       .Sequential()                # Send in order
       .Retry(2)                     # Retry failed items individually
       .Text("First message").Text("Second message")
       .send_all())
```

Batch execution uses a **fail-continue** strategy: failure of one message does not interrupt others, and failed items are automatically retried. The batch also supports `Hook` (triggered after all succeed), `OnError` (triggered when any fail), and `OnProgress` (progress callback) for the entire batch.

> For more detailed rules and batch build instructions, refer to [SendDSL Detailed Explanation](../developer-guide/adapters/send-dsl.md).

### Event Listening

There are three ways to listen for events:

1. Platform-native event listening:
   ```python
   from ErisPulse.Core import adapter, logger
   
   @adapter.on("event_type", raw=True, platform="{AdapterName}")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received native {AdapterName} event: {data}")
   ```

2. OneBot12 standard event listening:
   ```python
   from ErisPulse.Core import adapter, logger

   # Listen for OneBot12 standard events
   @adapter.on("event_type")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received standard event: {data}")

   # Listen for standard events from a specific platform
   @adapter.on("event_type", platform="{AdapterName}")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received {AdapterName} standard event: {data}")
   ```

3. Event module listening:
    Events provided by the `Event` module are based on the `adapter.on()` function, so the event format provided by `Event` is a OneBot12 standard event.

    ```python
    from ErisPulse.Core.Event import message, notice, request, command

    message.on_message()(message_handler)
    notice.on_notice()(notice_handler)
    request.on_request()(request_handler)
    command("hello", help="Send greeting message", usage="hello")(command_handler)

    async def message_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received message: {event}")
    async def notice_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received notice: {event}")
    async def request_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received request: {event}")
    async def command_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received command: {event}")
    ```

Among these, it is most recommended to use the `Event` module for event handling, as the `Event` module provides a rich set of event types and methods for handling events.

## Standard Format
For easy reference, a simple event format is provided here. For detailed information, please refer to the links above.

> **Note:** The following format is the basic OneBot12 standard format. Each adapter may have extended fields based on this format. For details, please refer to the specific feature documentation of each adapter.

### Standard Event Format
The event transformation format that all adapters must implement:
```json
{
  "id": "event_123",
  "time": 1752241220,
  "type": "message",
  "detail_type": "group",
  "platform": "example_platform",
  "self": {"platform": "example_platform", "user_id": "bot_123"},
  "message_id": "msg_abc",
  "message": [
    {"type": "text", "data": {"text": "Hello"}}
  ],
  "alt_message": "Hello",
  "user_id": "user_456",
  "user_nickname": "ExampleUser",
  "group_id": "group_789"
}
```

### Standard Response Format
#### Message Sent Successfully
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "retcode": 0,
  "data": {
    "message_id": "1234",
    "time": 1632847927.599013
  },
  "message_id": "1234",
  "message": "",
  "echo": "1234",
  "{platform}_raw": {...}
}
```

#### Message Sent Failed
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "retcode": 10003,
  "data": null,
  "message_id": "",
  "message": "Missing required parameters",
  "echo": "1234",
  "{platform}_raw": {...}
}
```
