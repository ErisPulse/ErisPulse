## Platform Specific Features

This section is maintained by developers of each adapter to explain the differences and extended features of that adapter compared to the OneBot12 standard. Please refer to the detailed documentation for the following platforms:

- [Maintenance Notes](maintain-notes.md)

- [Yunhu Platform Features](yunhu.md)
- [Yunhu User Platform Features](yunhu-user.md)
- [Telegram Platform Features](telegram.md)
- [OneBot11 Platform Features](onebot11.md)
- [OneBot12 Platform Features](onebot12.md)
- [Email Platform Features](email.md)
- [Kook (Kaihei La) Platform Features](kook.md)
- [Matrix Platform Features](matrix.md)
- [QQ Official Bot Platform Features](qqbot.md)

> Additionally, there is a `sandbox` adapter, but this adapter does not require platform-specific feature documentation

## Common Interfaces

### Send Chained Invocation
All adapters support the following standard calling methods:

> **Note:** The `{AdapterName}` in the document needs to be replaced with the actual adapter name (e.g., `yunhu`, `telegram`, `onebot11`, `email`, etc.).

1. Specify type and ID: `To(type,id).Func()`
   ```python
   # Get adapter instance
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   
   # Send message
   await my_adapter.Send.To("user", "U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   yunhu = adapter.get("yunhu")
   await yunhu.Send.To("user", "U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
2. Specify ID only: `To(id).Func()`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   telegram = adapter.get("telegram")
   await telegram.Send.To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
3. Specify sending account: `Using(account_id)`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.Using("bot1").To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   onebot11 = adapter.get("onebot11")
   await onebot11.Send.Using("bot1").To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
4. Direct call: `Func()`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.Text("Broadcast message")
   
   # Example:
   email = adapter.get("email")
   await email.Send.Text("Broadcast message")
   ```

#### Asynchronous Sending and Result Processing

Methods of the Send DSL return `asyncio.Task` objects, which means you can choose whether to wait for the result immediately:

```python
# Get adapter instance
my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")

# Do not wait for result, message sent in background
task = my_adapter.Send.To("user", "123").Text("Hello")

# If you need to get the send result, you can wait later
result = await task
```

### Event Listening
There are three ways to listen for events:

1. Platform native event listening:
   ```python
   from ErisPulse.Core import adapter, logger
   
   @adapter.on("event_type", raw=True, platform="{AdapterName}")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received {AdapterName} native event: {data}")
   ```

2. OneBot12 standard event listening:
   ```python
   from ErisPulse.Core import adapter, logger

   # Listen for OneBot12 standard events
   @adapter.on("event_type")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received standard event: {data}")

   # Listen for specific platform's standard events
   @adapter.on("event_type", platform="{AdapterName}")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received {AdapterName} standard event: {data}")
   ```

3. Event module listening:
    The events of the `Event` module are based on the `adapter.on()` function, so the event format provided by `Event` is a OneBot12 standard event

    ```python
    from ErisPulse.Core.Event import message, notice, request, command

    message.on_message()(message_handler)
    notice.on_notice()(notice_handler)
    request.on_request()(request_handler)
    command("hello", help="Send greeting message", usage="hello")(command_handler)

    async def message_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received message: {event}")
    async def notice_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received notice: {event}")
    async def request_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received request: {event}")
    async def command_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received command: {event}")
    ```

Among these, using the `Event` module is the most recommended approach for event handling, as it provides a variety of event types, as well as rich event processing methods.

## Standard Formats
For reference purposes, simple event formats are provided here. For detailed information, please refer to the links above.

> **Note:** The following format is based on the basic OneBot12 standard format. Each adapter may have extended fields on top of this. For details, please refer to the specific feature documentation of each adapter.

### Standard Event Format
Event conversion format that all adapters must implement:
```json
{
  "id": "event_123",
  "time": 1752241220,
  "type": "message",
  "detail_type": "group",
  "platform": "example_platform",
  "self": {"platform": "example_platform", "user_id": "bot_123"},
  "message_id": "msg_abc",
  "message": [
    {"type": "text", "data": {"text": "Hello"}}
  ],
  "alt_message": "Hello",
  "user_id": "user_456",
  "user_nickname": "ExampleUser",
  "group_id": "group_789"
}
```

### Standard Response Format
#### Message Sending Success
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "retcode": 0,
  "data": {
    "message_id": "1234",
    "time": 1632847927.599013
  },
  "message_id": "1234",
  "message": "",
  "echo": "1234",
  "{platform}_raw": {...}
}
```

#### Message Sending Failed
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "retcode": 10003,
  "data": null,
  "message_id": "",
  "message": "Missing required parameters",
  "echo": "1234",
  "{platform}_raw": {...}
}
```
