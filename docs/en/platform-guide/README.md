## General Interfaces

### Chainable Send Calls
All adapters support the following standard calling methods:

> **Note:** `{AdapterName}` in the documentation must be replaced with the actual adapter name (such as `yunhu`, `telegram`, `onebot11`, `email`, etc.).

1. Specify type and ID: `To(type,id).Func()`
   ```python
   # Get adapter instance
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   
   # Send message
   await my_adapter.Send.To("user", "U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   yunhu = adapter.get("yunhu")
   await yunhu.Send.To("user", "U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
2. Specify only ID: `To(id).Func()`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   telegram = adapter.get("telegram")
   await telegram.Send.To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
3. Specify sending account: `Using(account_id)`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.Using("bot1").To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   
   # Example:
   onebot11 = adapter.get("onebot11")
   await onebot11.Send.Using("bot1").To("U1001").Text("Hello")
   ```
4. Direct call: `Func()`
   ```python
   my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")
   await my_adapter.Send.Text("Broadcast message")
   
   # Example:
   email = adapter.get("email")
   await email.Send.Text("Broadcast message")
   ```

#### Asynchronous Sending and Result Handling

The methods of the Send DSL return an `asyncio.Task` object, which means you can choose whether to wait for the result immediately:

```python
# Get adapter instance
my_adapter = adapter.get("{AdapterName}")

# Do not wait for the result, the message is sent in the background
task = my_adapter.Send.To("user", "123").Text("Hello")

# If you need to get the sending result, you can wait later
result = await task
```

#### Sending Rule Decorators

In actual development, it is often necessary to: execute subsequent logic only after successful sending, automatically retry on failure, cancel on timeout, and monitor sending progress. The Send DSL includes a set of built-in sending rule decorators, which can be added via chained methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.Hook(callback)` | Callback executed after successful sending (can be called multiple times) |
| `.Retry(times=1)` | Automatic retry on failure N times (total of N+1 attempts, including the first) |
| `.Timeout(seconds)` | Single sending timeout, cancellation on timeout (can be stacked with Retry) |
| `.Defer(seconds)` | Delay sending (in-process timing, not persisted) |
| `.OnProgress(callback)` | Progress callback at each stage, passing SendContext |
| `.OnError(callback)` | Error callback on final failure (triggers only once) |

```python
yunhu = adapter.get("yunhu")

# Deduct points only after successful sending
await (yunhu.Send.To("user", "123")
       .Hook(lambda r: deduct_points("123"))
       .Text("Consumption successful"))

# Retry on failure + timeout cancellation + progress monitoring
def on_progress(ctx):
    print(f"Stage: {ctx.stage}, Attempt: {ctx.attempt + 1}/{ctx.max_attempts}")

task = (yunhu.Send.To("user", "123")
        .Retry(3)              # Retry up to 3 times
        .Timeout(10)           # Timeout of 10 seconds per attempt
        .OnProgress(on_progress)
        .OnError(lambda ctx: notify_admin(ctx.error))
        .Text("Important notice"))
```

Rule methods return `self`, so they must be called before the sending methods (such as Text/Image). `SendContext` contains fields such as `stage` (pending/sending/retrying/success/failed/timeout), `attempt`, `elapsed`, `error`, `result`, which are useful for monitoring.

#### Batch Build Mode (Build)

Multiple sending methods can be built within a single chain, and executed together at the end. This is suitable for scenarios where multiple messages are sent at once:

```python
yunhu = adapter.get("yunhu")

# Build multiple messages and send them together
results = await (yunhu.Send.To("user", "123")
                .Build()                     # Enter build mode
                .Text("Notification 1")
                .Image("pic.jpg")
                .Text("Notification 2")
                .send_all())                 # Execute all at once
# results = [Text result, Image result, Text result]
```

`.send_all()` executes by default **in parallel** (concurrent sending, high efficiency). If the order of message arrival needs to be guaranteed, call `.Sequential()` to execute serially:

```python
# Sequential execution (guarantee order) + retry on failure
await (yunhu.Send.To("group", "456")
       .Build()
       .Sequential()                # Send in order
       .Retry(2)                     # Retry failed entries individually
       .Text("First message").Text("Second message")
       .send_all())
```

Batch execution adopts a **fail-continue** strategy: failure of one message does not interrupt others, and failed entries are automatically retried. Batch also supports `Hook` for the entire batch (triggered after all succeed), `OnError` (triggered when there are failures), and `OnProgress` (progress callback).

> For more detailed information on rules and batch building, please refer to [SendDSL Detailed Explanation](../developer-guide/adapters/send-dsl.md).

### Event Listening
There are three ways to listen to events:

1. Platform-native event listening:
   ```python
   from ErisPulse.Core import adapter, logger
   
   @adapter.on("event_type", raw=True, platform="{AdapterName}")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received raw {AdapterName} event: {data}")
   ```

2. OneBot12 standard event listening:
   ```python
   from ErisPulse.Core import adapter, logger

   # Listen to OneBot12 standard events
   @adapter.on("event_type")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received standard event: {data}")

   # Listen to specific platform's standard events
   @adapter.on("event_type", platform="{AdapterName}")
   async def handler(data):
       logger.info(f"Received {AdapterName} standard event: {data}")
   ```

3. Event module listening:
    Events in the `Event` module are based on the `adapter.on()` function, so the event format provided by `Event` is a OneBot12 standard event.

    ```python
    from ErisPulse.Core.Event import message, notice, request, command

    message.on_message()(message_handler)
    notice.on_notice()(notice_handler)
    request.on_request()(request_handler)
    command("hello", help="Send a greeting message", usage="hello")(command_handler)

    async def message_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received message: {event}")
    async def notice_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received notice: {event}")
    async def request_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received request: {event}")
    async def command_handler(event):
        logger.info(f"Received command: {event}")
    ```

Among these, it is most recommended to use the `Event` module for event handling, because the `Event` module provides rich event types and event handling methods.

## Standard Formats
For easy reference, the following are basic event formats. For detailed information, please refer to the links above.

> **Note:** The following formats are basic OneBot12 standard formats. Each adapter may have extended fields based on this. Please refer to the specific feature descriptions of each adapter for details.

### Standard Event Format
All adapters must implement the event conversion format:
```json
{
  "id": "event_123",
  "time": 1752241220,
  "type": "message",
  "detail_type": "group",
  "platform": "example_platform",
  "self": {"platform": "example_platform", "user_id": "bot_123"},
  "message_id": "msg_abc",
  "message": [
    {"type": "text", "data": {"text": "Hello"}}
  ],
  "alt_message": "Hello",
  "user_id": "user_456",
  "user_nickname": "ExampleUser",
  "group_id": "group_789"
}
```

### Standard Response Format
#### Message Sending Success
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "retcode": 0,
  "data": {
    "message_id": "1234",
    "time": 1632847927.599013
  },
  "message_id": "1234",
  "message": "",
  "echo": "1234",
  "{platform}_raw": {...}
}
```

#### Message Sending Failure
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "retcode": 10003,
  "data": null,
  "message_id": "",
  "message": "Missing required parameters",
  "echo": "1234",
  "{platform}_raw": {...}
}
```
