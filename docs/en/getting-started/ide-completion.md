# Type Stub Generation (IDE Completion)

ErisPulse dynamically discovers modules/adapters via entry-points, and the exact types of user classes are not known at the static level. The `epsdk types` command scans installed modules/adapters and generates a type stub file, allowing users to use these types as variable annotations to obtain IDE completion.

## Core Design Principles

The stub file **only exports types**, without providing any runtime instances:

- All imports are under ``TYPE_CHECKING``, **zero runtime overhead, zero behavior change**
- Type names use the PascalCase form of the entry-point name (e.g., ``yunhu`` → ``Yunhu``), corresponding to the names passed into ``sdk.adapter.get()`` / ``sdk.module.get()``
- Users use ``sdk.module.get(...)`` / ``sdk.adapter.get(...)`` as usual to get instances, but use imported types for **variable annotations**

## Basic Usage

Run in the project root directory:

```bash
epsdk types
```

This generates `_ep_types.py` in the current directory, containing types for all installed modules/adapters.

## Using in Code

```python
from _ep_types import MyModule, Yunhu
from ErisPulse import sdk

# Using imported types as variable annotations enables IDE completion for the class methods
my_mod: MyModule = sdk.module.get("MyModule")
my_mod.hello()                  # ← IDE completes hello

my_adapter: Yunhu = sdk.adapter.get("yunhu")
await my_adapter.Send.To("group", "123").Board(...)   # ← Completes platform-specific methods
```

## How It Works

1. Scan `erispulse.adapter` / `erispulse.module` entry-points
2. Use a subprocess to introspect in the target Python environment, collecting actual class information for each adapter/module (including module path and qualified name)
3. Generate a `.py` file, where:
   - All ``from xxx import Yyy as Zzz`` are under ``TYPE_CHECKING``
   - ``Zzz`` is the PascalCase form of the entry-point name
4. The IDE reads the ``TYPE_CHECKING`` section to provide completion; no code is executed at runtime

Example of generated stub:

```python
# _ep_types.py (auto-generated)
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    # Adapters
    from MyAdapter.Core import MyAdapter as MyAdapter
    from YunhuAdapter.Core import YunhuAdapter as Yunhu

    # Modules
    from MyModule.Core import Main as MyModule

    __all__ = ['MyAdapter', 'Yunhu', 'MyModule']
```

## Command Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-o, --output PATH` | Specify the output file path (default `./_ep_types.py`) |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing stub file |
| `--adapters-only` | Only scan adapters |
| `--modules-only` | Only scan modules |

## When to Regenerate

- After installing/uninstalling new modules or adapters
- After modules/adapters update their public API
- When IDE completion fails or types are outdated

## Relationship with SendDSL Standard Methods

The `SendDSL` base class already includes standard send methods (Text/Image/Voice/Video/File), so any way of obtaining a `SendDSL` instance can complete these methods. The `types` command is mainly used to complete **platform-specific methods** (e.g., Yunhu's `Board`, Sandbox's `Dice`) and **module-specific methods**.
