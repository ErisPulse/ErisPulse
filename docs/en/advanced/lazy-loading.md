# Lazy Loading Module System

The ErisPulse SDK provides a powerful lazy loading module system, allowing modules to be initialized only when actually needed, thereby significantly improving application startup speed and memory efficiency.

## Overview

The lazy loading module system is one of the core features of ErisPulse. It works through the following mechanisms:

- **Delayed Initialization**: Modules are actually loaded and initialized only when they are accessed for the first time.
- **Transparent Usage**: For developers, there is almost no difference in usage between lazy-loaded modules and ordinary modules.
- **Automatic Dependency Management**: Module dependencies are automatically initialized when used.
- **Lifecycle Support**: For modules inheriting from `BaseModule`, lifecycle methods are automatically called.

## How It Works

### The LazyModule Class

The core of the lazy loading system is the `LazyModule` class, which acts as a wrapper that actually initializes the module only upon first access.

### Initialization Process

When a module is accessed for the first time, `LazyModule` performs the following operations:

1. Retrieves the `__init__` parameter information of the module class.
2. Decides whether to pass the `sdk` reference based on the parameters.
3. Sets the `moduleInfo` attribute of the module.
4. For modules inheriting from `BaseModule`, calls the `on_load` method.
5. Triggers the `module.init` lifecycle event.

## Configuring Lazy Loading

### Global Configuration

Enable/disable global lazy loading in the configuration file:

```toml
[ErisPulse.framework]
enable_lazy_loading = true  # true=enable lazy loading (default), false=disable lazy loading
```

### Module-level Control

Modules can control their loading strategy by implementing the static method `get_load_strategy()`:

```python
from ErisPulse.Core.Bases import BaseModule
from ErisPulse.loaders import ModuleLoadStrategy

class MyModule(BaseModule):
    @staticmethod
    def get_load_strategy():
        """Return the module loading strategy"""
        return ModuleLoadStrategy(
            lazy_load=False,  # Returning False means immediate loading
            priority=100      # Loading priority, higher value means higher priority
        )
```

## Using Lazy Loaded Modules

### Basic Usage

For developers, lazy-loaded modules are almost indistinguishable from ordinary modules in terms of usage:

```python
# Access lazy-loaded modules via SDK
from ErisPulse import sdk

# The following access will trigger module lazy loading
result = await sdk.my_module.my_method()
```

### Asynchronous Initialization

For modules requiring asynchronous initialization, it is recommended to load them explicitly first:

```python
# Explicitly load the module first
await sdk.load_module("my_module")

# Then use the module
result = await sdk.my_module.my_method()
```

### Synchronous Initialization

For modules that do not require asynchronous initialization, you can access them directly:

```python
# Direct access will automatically trigger synchronous initialization
result = sdk.my_module.some_sync_method()
```

## Best Practices

### Scenarios Recommended for Lazy Loading (lazy_load=True)

- ✅ Most functional modules
- ✅ Command processing modules
- ✅ On-demand extension features

### Scenarios Recommended for Disabling Lazy Loading (lazy_load=False)

- ❌ Lifecycle event listeners
- ❌ Scheduled task modules
- ❌ Modules that need to be initialized when the application starts

### Loading Priority

```python
from ErisPulse.loaders import ModuleLoadStrategy

class MyModule(BaseModule):
    @staticmethod
    def get_load_strategy():
        return ModuleLoadStrategy(
            lazy_load=False,  # Load immediately
            priority=100      # High priority, higher value means higher priority
        )
```

## Notes

1. If your module uses lazy loading, it will never be initialized if it is never called within ErisPulse by other modules.
2. If your module includes components such as Event listeners, or other similar active monitoring modules, please be sure to declare that they need to be loaded immediately, otherwise it will affect the normal business logic of your module.
3. We do not recommend disabling lazy loading; unless there are special requirements, doing so may lead to issues such as dependency management and lifecycle event problems.
