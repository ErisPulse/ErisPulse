# ErisPulse Glossary

This document explains common technical terms used in ErisPulse to help you better understand the framework's concepts.

## Core Concepts

### Event-Driven Architecture
**Simple Explanation:** Like a restaurant ordering system. Customers (users) order dishes (send messages), waiters (event system) pass the order (event) to the kitchen (modules), and after the kitchen processes it, the waiter serves the food (reply) to the customer.

**Technical Explanation:** The program's execution flow is triggered by external events rather than executing in a fixed sequence. Whenever a new event occurs (such as receiving a message), the framework automatically calls the corresponding handler function.

### OneBot12 Standard
**Simple Explanation:** Like the standard for sockets and plugs. The "plugs" (native event formats) of different platforms vary, but through converters, they all become a unified "plug" (OneBot12 format), so your code can act like a socket to adapt to all platforms.

**Technical Explanation:** A unified chatbot application interface standard that defines unified formats for events, messages, APIs, etc., allowing code to be reused across different platforms.

### Adapter
**Simple Explanation:** Like a translator. Different platforms speak different "languages" (API formats). The adapter translates these "languages" into "Mandarin" (OneBot12 standard) that ErisPulse can understand, and also translates ErisPulse's instructions back into the "languages" of each platform.

**Technical Explanation:** A component responsible for communicating with a specific platform. It receives native events from the platform and converts them into a standard format, or sends standard format requests to the platform.

### Module
**Simple Explanation:** Like an APP on a phone. Each module is an independent feature pack that can be added, deleted, or updated. Examples include "Weather Forecast Module", "Music Player Module", etc.

**Technical Explanation:** The basic unit of feature extension, containing specific business logic, event handlers, and configuration, which can be installed and uninstalled independently.

### Event
**Simple Explanation:** Like a notification on a phone. When there is a new message, new friend, or new group chat, the platform sends a "notification" (event) to your bot.

**Technical Explanation:** Anything notable happening on the platform, such as receiving a message, a user joining a group, a friend request, etc., is passed to the program in the form of structured data.

### Event Handler
**Simple Explanation:** Like a courier's delivery rules. When a "package" (event) is received, it decides who handles this package based on the package type (message, notice, request, etc.).

**Technical Explanation:** Functions marked with decorators that are automatically executed when a specific type of event occurs, such as `@command`, `@message`, etc.

## Development Related Terms

### SDK
**Simple Explanation:** Like a toolbox. It contains various common tools (storage, configuration, logs, etc.) that you can use directly when writing code, without reinventing the wheel.

**Technical Explanation:** Software Development Kit, which provides a set of pre-built components and tools to simplify the development process.

### Virtual Environment
**Simple Explanation:** Like an independent "workshop". Each project has its own "workshop", and the software packages installed inside do not interfere with each other, avoiding version conflicts.

**Technical Explanation:** An isolated Python environment where each environment has an independent package list and versions, preventing dependency conflicts between different projects.

### Asynchronous Programming
**Simple Explanation:** Like multitasking. The bot can do multiple things at once. For example, while waiting for a network response, it can still process messages from other users without freezing.

**Technical Explanation:** A programming style using `async`/`await` keywords that allows the program to switch to other tasks while waiting for time-consuming operations (such as network requests, file reading/writing), improving efficiency.

### Hot Reload
**Simple Explanation:** Like auto-refresh on a webpage. After you modify the code, you don't need to manually restart the bot; it automatically loads the new code, taking effect immediately.

**Technical Explanation:** In development mode, the program automatically detects file changes and reloads, allowing code modifications to take effect without a manual restart.

### Lazy Loading
**Simple Explanation:** Like drawers opened on demand. Unused drawers (modules) stay closed first and are only opened when needed, so you don't have to wait for all drawers to open during startup.

**Technical Explanation:** A delayed loading strategy where modules are initialized and loaded only when first accessed, reducing startup time and resource usage.

## Function Related Terms

### Command
**Simple Explanation:** Like a command in a game. When a user types a command like `/hello`, the bot executes the corresponding function.

**Technical Explanation:** A message starting with a specific prefix (such as `/`) that is recognized by the framework as a command and routed to the corresponding handler function.

### Reply
**Simple Explanation:** It is the "answer" the bot gives to the user. Whether it is text, image, or voice, it is a reply to the user's message.

**Technical Explanation:** The process where the adapter sends processing results back to the platform to be displayed to the user.

### Storage
**Simple Explanation:** Like the bot's "notepad". It can remember user information, settings, chat history, etc., so they can be found next time.

**Technical Explanation:** A persistent data storage system based on SQLite that implements key-value pair storage, used to save data that needs to be retained for a long time.

### Configuration
**Simple Explanation:** Like the bot's "settings". You can modify the bot's behavior through configuration files, such as changing port numbers, log levels, etc.

**Technical Explanation:** A configuration management system using TOML format, used to set various parameters for the framework and modules.

### Log
**Simple Explanation:** Like the bot's "diary". It records what the bot did and what problems it encountered, facilitating debugging and troubleshooting.

**Technical Explanation:** Recorded information generated during system runtime, including different levels such as info, warning, error, etc., used for monitoring and debugging.

### Router
**Simple Explanation:** Like traffic police directing traffic. Decides which request should go to which place to be processed, such as web requests, WebSocket connections, etc.

**Technical Explanation:** HTTP and WebSocket router manager that distributes requests to corresponding handler functions based on URL paths.

## Platform Related Terms

### Platform
**Simple Explanation:** The place where the bot works, such as Yunhu, Telegram, QQ, etc. Each platform has its own rules and API.

**Technical Explanation:** An application or service that provides chatbot services, such as Yunhu Enterprise Communication, Telegram, etc.

### OneBot11/12
**Simple Explanation:** Like the "International Standard" for chatbots. It defines unified formats for messages, events, etc., so that different software can understand each other.

**Technical Explanation:** OneBot is a universal chatbot application interface standard that defines formats for events, messages, APIs, etc. 11 and 12 are different versions of the standard.

### SendDSL
**Simple Explanation:** Like a "shortcut" for sending messages. You can send various types of messages (text, images, @someone, etc.) with a simple one-line statement.

**Technical Explanation:** A chained message sending interface that provides concise syntax to build and send complex messages.

## Other Terms

### Lifecycle
**Simple Explanation:** The bot's "life": Birth (startup), Work (running), Rest (stop). The lifecycle refers to events triggered at these key moments.

**Technical Explanation:** Key stages during the program's runtime, such as startup, loading modules, unloading modules, shutdown, etc. Operations can be executed by listening to these events.

### Annotation/Decorator
**Simple Explanation:** It is putting a "label" on a function. For example, the `@command("hello")` label tells the framework: This is a command handler named "hello".

**Technical Explanation:** Python syntactic sugar used to modify the behavior of functions or classes. In ErisPulse, it is used to mark event handlers, routes, etc.

### Type Annotation
**Simple Explanation:** It is telling the function what "type" the parameters are. For example, `request: Request` indicates that this parameter is a Request object.

**Technical Explanation:** A feature introduced in Python 3.5+ used to annotate the types of variables and parameters, improving code readability and type safety.

### TOML
**Simple Explanation:** A configuration file format that is more readable than JSON and stricter than YAML, suitable for writing configurations.

**Technical Explanation:** Tom's Obvious Minimal Language, a configuration file format with concise and clear syntax, widely used in Python project configuration management.
