This SDK's core adapter standardization layer strictly follows OneBot12 specifications (https://12.onebot.dev/) for:
- Event data normalization
- API request/response formats
- Message segment definitions
- Metadata definitions

This ensures consistent behavior and interoperability across all adapter implementations.
